**PwnFuzz** is a personal security research effort focused on vulnerability discovery, exploit development, and offensive tooling. The work revolves around practical targets—real-world binaries, enterprise applications, and OS internals—mostly through fuzzing, reversing, and custom tool development.

## Behind PwnFuzz

**PwnFuzz** was founded by [**D4mianWayne**](https://github.com/D4mianWayne), an exploit developer and red teamer with a background in low-level systems and offensive engineering. This initiative is where research, tooling, and learning are all pushed forward in one place.
