CVE-2024-21338 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows AppLocker driver (`appid.sys`). The flaw resides in the `AipSmartHashImageFile` function, reachable via IOCTL `0x22A018`, which allows user-mode input to control code execution. Specifically, the function dereferences two user-provided pointers from a shared SystemBuffer without verifying their validity or origin. One of these pointers is treated as a function pointer and is called directly from kernel mode. The patched version adds checks to ensure the input does not originate from user mode and restricts access.

**CVE-2024-21338:** https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-21338  
**Vulnerability Type:** Untrusted Pointer Dereference  
**Tested On:** Windows 11 23H2  
**Driver Version:** appid.sys - 10.0.22621.3155    

## Vulnerability analysis


```c++
__int64 __fastcall AipDeviceIoControlDispatch(struct _DEVICE_OBJECT *a1, IRP *_IRP)
{


[::]

      case 0x22A018u:
        if ( WPP_GLOBAL_Control != (PDEVICE_OBJECT)&WPP_GLOBAL_Control && (HIDWORD(WPP_GLOBAL_Control->Timer) & 2) != 0 )
          WPP_SF_(WPP_GLOBAL_Control->AttachedDevice, 27LL, &WPP_1ce862bc955b392889c1b25f85145990_Traceguids);
        if ( CurrentStackLocation->Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength == 32 )
        {
          ConfigOptions = AipSmartHashImageFile((__int64)_IRP->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer, 0LL, 0LL, 0LL); // Call to AipSmartHashImageFile with User input
LABEL_103:
          v9 = ConfigOptions;
          break;
        }
LABEL_25:
        v9 = -1073741811;
        break;
      default:
        v7 = WPP_GLOBAL_Control;
        if ( WPP_GLOBAL_Control == (PDEVICE_OBJECT)&WPP_GLOBAL_Control || (HIDWORD(WPP_GLOBAL_Control->Timer) & 2) == 0 )
          goto LABEL_15;

Following up, the process takes the following path and performs several checks. The main check happens in `appid!AipSmartHashImageFile()` whose primary functionality is passing the value at `SystemBuffer + 8` to [`ObfReferenceObject()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-obfreferenceobject). This routine increments the reference count of the specified object, which implies that the value at SystemBuffer + 8 must be a valid kernel object address. Otherwise, the reference operation will fail or potentially lead to a crash.

It calls the function pointer stored at `SystemBuffer + 16`, passing the value at `SystemBuffer` (i.e., the first 8 bytes) as an argument.

```c++
__int64 __fastcall AppHashComputeImageHashInternal(
        __int64 SystemBuffer,
        __int64 (__fastcall **SystemBuffer_16)(__int64, __int128 *),
        unsigned int a3,
        __int64 a4)
{

[::]

  __int64 v43; // [rsp+A8h] [rbp+Fh]

  v39 = SystemBuffer_16;
  *(_QWORD *)v32 = a4;
  v40 = SystemBuffer;
  v29 = 0;
  v37 = 0LL;
  v38 = 0LL;
  v5 = 0;
  v43 = 0LL;
  v6 = 0;
  v30 = 0;
  v33 = 0;
  v34 = 0;
  LODWORD(v35) = 0;
  *(_QWORD *)v41 = 0LL;
  v42 = 0LL;
  if ( !a3 )
    return 0;
  v7 = (*SystemBuffer_16)(SystemBuffer, &v42); // Vulnerable function call


[::]

```

This is a sample structure of how the input should be defined:

```c
typedef struct SMART_HASH_INPUT {
    DWORD64 Arguments_Ptr;
    PVOID Object_Ptr;
    PVOID ExpProfileDelete_Ptr;
    DWORD64 PADDING;
} _SMART_HASH_INPUT, *PSMART_HASH_INPUT;
```
- `Object_Ptr` must be a valid object pointer that satisfies the expectations of `AipSmartHashImageFile()`.
- `ExpProfileDelete_Ptr` is the API that will be invoked. This call is routed through `guard_dispatch_icall_fpt`, which enforces Kernel Control Flow Guard (KCFG). The `nt!ExpProfileDelete()` function ultimately calls the `ObfDereferenceObjectWithTag` kernel macro.
- This macro decrements the reference count field of the object passed to it (located at offset -0x30). This behavior makes it ideal for modifying the `PreviousMode` of a threadâ€”from a user-mode value of 1 to a kernel-mode value of 0.
- To achieve this, we need to pass the address of `nt!ExpProfileDelete()` to `ExpProfileDelete_Ptr`, and `Arguments_Ptr` must point to the `KTHREAD.PreviousMode` field of the current thread.
