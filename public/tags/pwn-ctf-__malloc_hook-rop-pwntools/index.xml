      <description>&lt;p&gt;I played this CTF event with the WeakButLeet team and in the end, we managed to get 18th rank, sadly we couldnâ€™t do much crypto challenges but overall it was a fun CTF to get refreshed, there were other CTFs running as well but I only played this as there was a local CTF going on. In the end, I manage to solve 7/8 pwn challenges and remaining one was solved by Faith, super talented guy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
