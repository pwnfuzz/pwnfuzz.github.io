      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, we’ll delve into two critical vulnerabilities recently discovered in the HPE Insight Remote Support (IRS) application, versions prior to &lt;code&gt;v7.14.0.629&lt;/code&gt;. These vulnerabilities—CVE-2024-53675 (unauthenticated XXE vulnerability) and CVE-2024-53676 (Remote Code Execution, or RCE vulnerability)—pose significant security risks, allowing unauthorized access and arbitrary code execution on vulnerable systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the holiday vibes going around, I had no plans on releasing any posts but as I was working through this, I learned few things about secure coding practices and hunting for these reported vulnerabilities gives a good practice to understand the researcher&amp;rsquo;s thought process and perhaps perform variant analysis in a similar situation. The Insight Remote Support application by HPE is used to gather information and statistics for multiple other hardwares such as printers and stuff, there are certain servlets exposed through web UI, accessible without authentication allowing exploitation of all the reported vulnerabilities much easier and with no dependency on credentials. A bit of background in regards with the software is that the web server is based on Tomcat server and perhaps you may have guessed by now the backend is developed on Java.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog provides an in-depth analysis of the exploitation process for an unauthenticated XXE vulnerability in Ivanti Endpoint Manager, identified as CVE-2024-37397.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;uncovering-the-importxml-vulnerability&#34;&gt;Uncovering the &lt;code&gt;ImportXml&lt;/code&gt; Vulnerability&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/ivanti-cve-2024-37397/zdi-overview.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability was identified by 06fe5fd2bc53027c4a3b7e395af0b850e7b8a044 and detailed in the ZDI advisory, which provided key information about the affected component. The advisory mentioned that the XXE vulnerability was found in the &lt;code&gt;ImportXml&lt;/code&gt; function, guiding us to search for references to this specific function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
